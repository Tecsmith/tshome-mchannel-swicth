# ESP32 VROOM vs. SOLO-2 form-factor comparison

The **ESP32 WROOM** and **ESP32 SOLO-2** are both modules from Espressif Systems, but they have some notable differences, particularly in terms of **processing capabilities**, **features**, **pin count**, **form factor**, and **target applications**. Below, I will highlight the key differences between the two:

### 1. **Microcontroller Core**
- **ESP32 WROOM**:
  - The ESP32 WROOM series is based on the **ESP32-D0WD** microcontroller, which has a **dual-core Xtensa LX6 processor**.
  - Each core can run at up to **240 MHz**, making it suitable for **multi-threaded applications** or cases where intensive tasks can be split across two cores.
  
- **ESP32 SOLO-2**:
  - The ESP32 SOLO-2 uses the **ESP32-S0WD** microcontroller, which features a **single-core Xtensa LX6 processor**.
  - This core also runs at up to **240 MHz**, but since it only has a single core, it is more suitable for simpler or **less CPU-intensive** tasks that do not require the parallel processing capabilities of the dual-core variant.

### 2. **Number of Cores**
- **ESP32 WROOM**: **Dual-core** (2 cores).
- **ESP32 SOLO-2**: **Single-core** (1 core).

### 3. **Processing Power and Use Cases**
- **ESP32 WROOM**:
  - With its dual-core processor, the ESP32 WROOM is designed to handle more **demanding applications**, allowing for better multitasking capabilities.
  - It's ideal for projects requiring **concurrent execution** of networking tasks (e.g., Wi-Fi) and other processes such as sensor data acquisition or control loops.
  
- **ESP32 SOLO-2**:
  - Due to its single-core architecture, the SOLO-2 is better suited for applications where **lower power consumption** is needed, and processing requirements are not as demanding.
  - Common use cases include **simple IoT devices**, low-power sensor nodes, or applications that primarily require Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity but do not need the extra processing capability of dual-core setups.

### 4. **Power Consumption**
- **ESP32 WROOM**:
  - Having two cores allows more processing power but also results in higher **power consumption**, especially when both cores are actively used.
  
- **ESP32 SOLO-2**:
  - With a single core, the power consumption is lower compared to dual-core ESP32 modules, making it advantageous for applications where **power efficiency** is crucial, such as battery-operated devices.

### 5. **Antenna Options and Form Factor**
- **ESP32 WROOM**:
  - Typically features a **PCB antenna** or an **IPEX connector** for an external antenna, depending on the variant.
  - **Form Factor**: The module is about **18 mm x 25.5 mm**, making it compact but not the smallest option in the ESP32 lineup.
  
- **ESP32 SOLO-2**:
  - Similar to the WROOM series, the SOLO-2 can come with a **PCB antenna** or an **IPEX connector**.
  - **Form Factor**: It has a similar footprint of around **18 mm x 20 mm**, making it slightly smaller than the WROOM.

### 6. **Pin Count and GPIO Availability**
- **ESP32 WROOM**:
  - The WROOM series generally offers **38-40 pins** with a variety of GPIOs, providing extensive connectivity options for peripherals such as sensors, actuators, and displays.

- **ESP32 SOLO-2**:
  - The SOLO-2 has **32 pins**, which means slightly fewer GPIO options compared to the WROOM module.
  - This reduction in pin count makes it better suited for simpler applications where fewer connections are needed.

### 7. **Cost**
- **ESP32 WROOM**:
  - Due to its **dual-core** capabilities, the cost of the ESP32 WROOM is generally **higher** compared to the SOLO-2.
  
- **ESP32 SOLO-2**:
  - The SOLO-2 is generally **more affordable**, which makes it a good choice for projects where cost is an important consideration and dual-core performance is not required.

### 8. **Performance vs. Efficiency Trade-off**
- **ESP32 WROOM**:
  - Ideal for applications needing more computational **horsepower** where multitasking is required, such as smart home controllers, video streaming, or projects with heavy networking and simultaneous sensor data processing.
  
- **ESP32 SOLO-2**:
  - Focused on **low-cost** and **low-power** use cases, such as single-purpose IoT devices, simple automation, or sensor hubs where **power efficiency** and cost are more important than computational power.
